# ecoshades

In this project the goal was to make a hero section for a fictional company called “ecoshades” who make sunglasses out of recycled materials, their target group was young adults in the city. 
I chose a modern and simple design with the shades being the main focus.  Instead of green I went with turquoise in the logo and also chose that same color as the accent color for the page.
